# School District Analysis

## Overview of the project 
The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned for help. The school wants to repalce the math and reading score for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

## Summary of the results 
### How is District Summary affected? 
The images below are the average math and reading scores of the school with percentage of passing the tests before and after removing the ninth graders' grades. We can see that there are bit of changes on numerical values after we removed ninth graders' grades.
